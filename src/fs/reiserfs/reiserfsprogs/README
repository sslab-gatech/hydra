[LICENSING]

ReiserFSprogs is hereby licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2
but with the following "Anti-Plagiarism" modification:   You may not remove any
credits  or  brand marks,  or cause them to not display,  unless you are an end
user  (that is,  you are not redistributing to others).  Yes,  there really are
people with the nerve  to remove credits from software  they did not write,  or
only wrote a small part of,  and they are even frequently occurring sad to say.
Credits are not ads,  credits describe  someone's  contribution  to the project
(e.g. labor or money) whereas an ad says something else.

Source   code   files   that   contain   the   phrase  "licensing  governed  by
reiserfsprogs/README" are "governed files" throughout that file. Governed files
are licensed under this license.  The portions of them owned by Hans Reiser, or
authorized to be licensed by him, have been in the past,  and likely will be in
the future,  licensed to other parties  under  other licenses.  If you add your
code to governed files,  and don't want it to be owned by Hans Reiser, put your
copyright label on that code  so  we  can  keep  things straight.  It will be a
kindness if you identify whether Hans Reiser is allowed to license code labeled
as owned by you on your behalf other than under this license,  because he wants
to  know  if  it  is  okay  to  do  so and  put a check in the mail to you (for
non-trivial improvements)  when he makes his next sale.  He makes no guarantees
as to  the amount if any,  though he feels motivated  to motivate contributors,
and you can surely discuss this with him before or after contributing. You have
the right to decline  to allow him to license your code contribution other than
under  this  license or the GPL.  Further  licensing  options are available for
commercial and/or other interests directly from reiser@namesys.com<P>

Hideous  Commercial  Pitch: Spread  your  development  costs  across  other  OS
vendors.  Select from the best in the world,  not the best in your building, by
buying from third party OS component suppliers. Leverage the software component
development power  of the internet.  Be the most aggressive in taking advantage
of the commercial possibilities of decentralized internet development,  and add
value through your branded integration  that  you  sell as an operating system. 
Let your competitors  be the ones  to compete  against  the entire  internet by
themselves.  Be hip,  get with the new economic trend,  before your competitors 
do. Send email to reiser@namesys.com.
